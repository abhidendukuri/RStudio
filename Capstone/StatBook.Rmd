```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source(file = "CleanedProperties.R")
```

## Stats Book

By this point, all the data has been analyzed and wrangled accordingly as shown by the filtered data shown below

```{r}
View(properties)
```

## Including Plots

I started creating some histograms to reveal some of the findings about some of the factors that I'd like delve deeper in:

```{r properties, echo=FALSE}
hist(properties$bath_count, xlim = range(1, 7))
hist(properties$bed_count, xlim = range(0, 7))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
